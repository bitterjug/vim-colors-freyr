My Gvim Colourscheme based on Freya
===================================

This is my vim colourscheme which I based on [freya][2]
(_Freyr_ was the brother of [Freyja][1]).  Maintains enough
contrast to still be usable with [Redshift][3] active.

- Monotone window borders look better than dashes
- Dark line numbers
- Dark diff backgrounds
